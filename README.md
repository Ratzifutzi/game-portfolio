# Game Portfolio for SAE
### Intro
This Repo contains some of the projects I started back in 2017. Most of these projects were created on the digital platform [ROBLOX](https://create.roblox.com/). Many of the projects don't reflect the way how I code anymore, due to their old age. **Please check out the README contained in every project for more information.** The assets folder is not important, it only contains some images used in the README files. **I wont show the codebase for most projects before 2020**, due to limited file size on GitHub.

### Projects

#### Recommended
I recommend checking out following projects:
- [*âœ¨ First game I made in Defold*](https://ratzifutzi.itch.io/harald)
- [My first bigger Project as a 11-12 year old (2019:11)](/projects/2019/11%20Innovation%20Spaceship/)
- [First code export](/projects/2019/12%20Dungeon%20Explorer/)
- [One of the most influential projects in my learning path](/projects/2020/13%20Factory%20Tycoon/)

#### Media Content
Most of the videos and pictures are stored on my website, due to the file size limit of GitHub. If you experience issues with playback or connectivity, please contact me asap under **webmaster@hyper-tech.ch**

#### README
Every project has it's own README. This file is structured in the following way:

Header  | Content
------- | -------
Platform / Engine | In which engine or platform the game was made
Project Details | Some information about the project, for example it's age.
Progess | How far I was into development
Original Idea | My initial thoughts on the game and what I intended to create
Codebase | What I think of the codebase used and if I would create it in the same way today.

#### Honourable Mentions
- [My first project regarding machine learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ratzifutzi/process-to-learn-ai/blob/main/day-1---numberAI.ipynb). The CDN for the training and eval data is sadly not online anymore.
- [My basic web service](https://github.com/Ratzifutzi/web/tree/development)
