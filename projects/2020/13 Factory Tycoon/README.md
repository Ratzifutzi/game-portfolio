### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
Another Tycoon, but one that I actually finished and didn't use a template. I created a datastore system, so the user keeps their data when they come back after leaving. The users were supposed to pick a path which they wanted to take, modern or old. In the modern path, you have really expensive machines that look futuristic and generate A LOT of income, whereas the "old" path contains rusty cheap machines, that generate lower income, but they are way cheaper. I also added my first monetization, you can buy ingame money with real money(80 Robux ~= 1CHF, 400 Robux ~= 5CHF). At the end, the last purchases don't work anymore. I also added localization, german <-> english translation. I would say this is one of the most important projects of my learning path. This is the first game where I actually earnt something: 0.50CHF - I know, it's a lot.
