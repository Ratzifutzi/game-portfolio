# 14

### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
In this project I create another spaceship, I collaborated with a friend. He created the map layout and I made the scripting. It took me ages to figure out, how to create doors, but eventually I managed to do it. The game is sadly not done but it follows the same game ideas as [my first spaceship](/projects/2019/11%20Innovation%20Spaceship/).

### Progess
Not finished

### Original Idea
A sequel to [my first spaceship](/projects/2019/11%20Innovation%20Spaceship/). I wanted to make a new game with my newfound knowledge etc.

### Codebase
100% by myself, unless explicitly mentioned in a comment at the top of the file. The quality of the code is TERRIBLE and there are a lot of issues, for example, the lights are updating more often than there are frames on your screen.
