### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This project was created when I was in my five nights at freddys phase. I planned many features and created my own animatronics. The animatronics are basically robots that try to kill you. You have to learn their attack patterns and special abilites. For example, as far as I remember,  one of them was hiding in the vents, trying to pull you in, the other one was roaming around while the other one just tries to find you. If it finds you, it will notify all the other ones over your location. You can block them off using doors or lights. But you need to be careful, not to blow the fuses. Once they break, you can't open nor close doors anymore. Fuses break more quickly if you use multiple things, like doors or light, at the same time. You have to survive till 6AM. One hour in the game is 60 seconds. I used the debug panel I've created in the game to show it off. Sadly, the AI for the animatronics never worked, but I created animatons for them - I show them off at the end of the video.

### Progess
Unfinished

### Original Idea

### Codebase
As far as I remeber, I coded everything. I am not a big fan of the code, mainly because of its poor organization.
