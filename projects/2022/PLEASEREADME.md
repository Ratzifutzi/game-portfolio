2022, I mainly worked on a project that I can't show publicly due to confidentiality. If you would like to see my code, feel free to message me and I will show it to you privately. I really recommend checking it out, because it reflects how I code.

2022, I also revamped my Area Game. I don't think the content is worth mentioning, that's why it is not included.

2022, I also created a lot, and I mean A LOT, of small projects, which would take too long to list. If you are interested, we can arrange a meeting and I will show them to you.
