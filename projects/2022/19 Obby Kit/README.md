# 19

### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
A system that counts the time you've spent on the obby and on what stage you are. If you fail a stage often, you can pay to skip that stage. I also added some visual effects. This code should reflect my work - even though it is old. A lot of the things I did in the code, I would do completely differently.

### Progess
Finished, except menus

### Original Idea
I got paid to create a kit for the creation of obbies. Please refer to [this project](/projects/2017/02%20Run%20Obby/) to know what obbies are.

### Codebase
100% by me, unless specifically mentioned. I use the same structure today, with some additions. Most of the code is fine, but would need some adjustments.
