### Project Details
Please view the audio commented video.
[Click to view project Video (ðŸ”ˆ)](https://hyper-tech.ch/!videos/SAE/08.mp4). There was an issue with the audio recording, the quality is not that great. Fixed in the next videos.

### Progess
Probably finished

### Original Idea
A game, where you have to keep the reactor under control. Make sure it's not too hot, and not too cold. I only coded the meltdown. There were Blast Doors that close in emergency situations, but they stopped working due to deprecated content used from the Roblox Engine, which have been sunsetted. I wanted to add multiple teams with many different roles.

### Codebase
Everything created by me. Cannot upload codebase due to the old age of the project and my export tool does not support it.
