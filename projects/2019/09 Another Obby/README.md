### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This is, yet another, obby. I created this with a friend, just for fun. I also attempted to code a checkpoint system, that failure is not that punishing. Because of old age, my code does not work anymore, and makes the engine crash. Pretty ironic, something thats supposed to make everything easier, makes it harder. That's why the recording is not the full obby.

### Progess
Unfinished, unknown progress.

### Original Idea
A christmas themed obby, resulted in random assets from the asset store thrown around to create an obby with pretty fun ideas.

### Codebase
Checkpoint system created by me, broke due to old age and no maintenance and drastic changes of the ROBLOX engine. Code not in good quality
