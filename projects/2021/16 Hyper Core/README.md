### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This is yet another core game I made. This one is actually playable and kinda works. I worked together with a friend, who is a 3D Designer, who created some assets for me. I needed to replace the music because the old one got removed due to copyright issues. I recommend watching the complete video, it shows off everything. Yes, I know it's long. The difference between 1.0 and 2.0 is, that I wanted to re-create everything because I was not happy with the code base. The only thing I actually did, was creating a train system. This took me so long. I also drew some maps for the game, which can be viewed below.

### Progess
Unfinished, split up in 2 parts.

### Original Idea
The player holds responsibility over a reactor, and a complete facility. I only managed to create the first 

### Codebase
As far as I remember, this project was COMPLETELY made bymyself. The code of the first project is really bad and unoptimized, but it's getting better than before. There are huge improvements on the second version, but I am still not a fan.
