### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This game was supposed to be a survival-story-horror game. I made the intro sequence and the beginning. I built everything by myself(As you can probably see). I didn't use Blender yet, so everything built is used with the Roblox Modeling Tool. The idea was, that you play as a janitor with low security clearance. You have to get higher clearances and figure out how everything works, adventure through the unknown facilities with things that may lurk in the dark. With a procedurally generated map, every playthrough will be different. The game starts as you playing a scientist with level 3 clearance. You go to an experiment and something goes terribly wrong. Kinda like in Half Life 1. I had more details but I lost all of the files. Everything used in the game (except some things in the cafeteria and some other models) are created by me.
