### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
I programmed a build system that supports an infinite amount of items, but I got stuck on items that are bigger than 1x1. But besides that, it's a pretty cool project. I also added a Database system to store players inventory + constructed objects.
