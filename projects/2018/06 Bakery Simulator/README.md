### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
I built everything, except the fences in the outdoor area. The blocks that drop on the conveyor are supposed to be the ingredients of dough, the other machine makes it to dough, and the thing that destroyer my character in the video is supposed to be a furnance. In the outside, there is an overflow conveyor belt.
