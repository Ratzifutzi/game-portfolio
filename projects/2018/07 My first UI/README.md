### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
Now, I wanted to give UI Design a shot. I had no idea what I was doing, I just tried out random stuff, see what it does, and this came up. The game is about 2 teams fighting against each other in a medival theme. One of the teams has to attack the castle, the other one has to defend. We will meet this project again later.
