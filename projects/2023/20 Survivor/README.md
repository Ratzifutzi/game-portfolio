### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This is extremely important. This project reflects how I code and organise. This project was supposed to be a finished game, but I sadly lost the freetime finish it.

### Progess
Unfinished

### Original Idea
The main goal is to keep the fire alive. The player must refuel it once in a while. The game is split up in phases: Day and night. At day, the player can collect resources reinforce the base. At night, they have to utlize their defenses to block off creatures that try to extinguish the fire. Really the only goal is to keep the fire alive. Make sure it doesn't run out of fuel and it doesn't break. The player itself is defenseless and can only use the buldings provided by the game. It is possible to build more complicated contraptions using logic gates and signals.

### Codebase
Everything except CMDR(A debug console, open source module) is created by me. I am really happy about the code and would only do small changes if I redo it today. Export can be found under the /project folder.
