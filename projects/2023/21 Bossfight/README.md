### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This was a comission for a friend of me. It is a shop for avatar item, where you can fight a boss for some free items. The game would earn through players coming back and sales or micro transactions(Revives, Donations). The Bossfight was supposed to have more phases and attacks, but time ran out. The code reflects my current work.

Nearly finished, only small things missing.

### Original Idea

### Codebase
Everything created by me, I would do most things the same today. There are some things that I am not happy with.
