### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
On this project, I went more into understanding the ROBLOX Game Engine and did more and more adjustments and built some more things. I also used a few free-assets I could find on the asset store and built a little Owner-Only area with fun gears. Again, I modified my save file to get unlimited money. You0ll start noticing that I changed more and more things comparing to the last tycoon. I know the PINs to the doors because I checked them before the recording.

### Progess
Unfinished, unknown progress.

### Original Idea
Build a train station with trains arriving and departing, Owner only area to troll my friends when playing with them.

### Codebase
Most of the code is from the free asset store, but I read all of it and tried to understand it.
