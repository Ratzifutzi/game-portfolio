### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This project was fully created by me, except the boat and the zombies. I wanted to create an obby that looks like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). I downloaded the images, uploaded them to ROBLOX and build my Obby. This alone took me days to do, and I was really proud of my creation back then. Some of the 3D assets are from the free asset store.

Unfinished, unknown progress.

### Original Idea
Create an obby that looks like Minecraft.

### Codebase
No code was created from me, nearly no code.
