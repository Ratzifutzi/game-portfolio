### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
This is one of the first projects where I followed a YouTube tutorial and wrote my FIRST CODE. Yes, I didn't come up with the code, but I wrote it and tried to understand it. Obby is the ROBLOX Term for jump and run games. The complete map was designed by me.
