### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on the **ROBLOX Platform.**

### Project Details
One of the first projects I ever made on the ROBLOX Platform. I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to create basic tycoon games. It was one of my favourite game genre, so games like this will come up a lot. A tycoon is basically a game where you generate money in some sort of way to build buildings, which will further increase your income or just for decoration purposes. In the video, I modified my savefile to have an endless amount of money, to speed up the progess.

### Progess
Unfinished, unknown progress.

### Original Idea
The player to build more houses that have factories in them, to generate more income, to build more houses resulting in a city.

### Codebase
*WAS NOT CREATED BY ME* - I used the codebase from the YouTube tutorial and adjusted some things as I liked. You will notice at what point things were created by me.
