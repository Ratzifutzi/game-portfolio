### Platform / Engine
This project was developed on **the ROBLOX platform.**

### Project Details
I downloaded the western template offered by ROBLOX and did my adjustments. I added more seats and added more rails with stations. This took me ages back then, it was really valuable for my knowledge, how to use the engine and tools that you have. Video edited to only show things changed by me.
